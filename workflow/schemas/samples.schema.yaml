description: row of the samples.tsv, representing full list of genome_ids with associated fasta files in raw data directory

# columns that the config/samples.tsv file can have and which type they should be
properties:
  genome_id:
    type: string
    description: genome id with genome version, same as fasta files stored in data/raw/fasta/ directory
  source:
    type: string
    description: source of the genome to be analyzed choose one of the following-
    'custom', 'ncbi', 'blob-container'
# custom  : for provided in the data/raw/fasta directory with gneome ids as filenames 
# ncbi : for list of public genome accession IDs that will be downloaded from the NCBI refseq database
# blob-container-url : for list of genomes from internal dataset that can be retrieved from blob containers
